# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to the maintainers with:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: We aim to respond within 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: We'll provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We'll work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate public disclosure after a fix is available

## Security Considerations

### Database Security

- All database credentials are encrypted at rest
- Connection strings use SSL/TLS when available
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- Connection pooling includes timeout and retry logic

### API Security

- JWT tokens for authentication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- CORS protection configured
- Security headers via Helmet.js

### AI Integration Security

- OpenAI API keys stored securely
- No sensitive data sent to AI services
- Input sanitization for AI queries
- Response validation and filtering

### Infrastructure Security

- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Regular dependency security scanning
- Automated security updates

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to the SDK project:

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Validate all inputs** - Use proper validation schemas
3. **Use parameterized queries** - Prevent SQL injection
4. **Implement proper authentication** - Follow JWT best practices
5. **Keep dependencies updated** - Monitor for security advisories
6. **Follow secure coding practices** - Review code for vulnerabilities

## Automated Security Measures

- **GitHub CodeQL** - Static analysis for vulnerability detection
- **Snyk Scanning** - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **npm audit** - Package vulnerability checking
- **Dependabot** - Automated security updates
- **Secret scanning** - Prevent accidental secret commits

## Security Hardening

### Production Deployment

- Use environment-specific configurations
- Enable all security middleware
- Configure proper CORS origins
- Use HTTPS/SSL certificates
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Regular security assessments

### Database Hardening

- Use dedicated database users with minimal privileges
- Enable MySQL SSL connections
- Regular backup and recovery testing
- Monitor for unusual query patterns
- Implement connection rate limiting

Thank you for helping keep the SDK secure!
